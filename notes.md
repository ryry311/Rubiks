Phase 1: Interface
   Displaying a 3D cube is hard
   Turning is complicated
   Make sure it works

Phase 2: Optimize that interface
   It needs to be super fast so you can run it a billion times

Phase 3: Design a solver
   Use preexisting algorithms

Phase 4: Make the solver AI
   Neural net?
   Whats the cost function

Phase 5: Make it pretty
   Add some front end stuff
   Way to enter cube configuration
   3D?
